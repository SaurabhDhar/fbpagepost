For now we are waiting only backend job to be done.
Front-end part can be simple forms.

This functions to be implemented:
1. User can grant access to pages / groups - automated. Now we have to indicate keys manually.
2. User can make post at chosen page / groups.
3. User can schedule post at chosen page / groups.
4. User can upload image/video/link post planning.

After this part will be done, we will move to editing, rescheduling, etc.

Is this list enough to quote?
